**Creating a 3D Visualization for 938 unrelated individuals from the Human Genome Diversity Project**

*I downloaded data of 938 people from website by using wget command*

`wget http://csg.sph.umich.edu/chaolong/LASER/HGDP-938-632958.tar.gz`
 
 I used data set which is provided in the LASER software, the data processing procedure description in the supplementary materials of the LASER paper (Wang et. al., 2014), (1) For the original HGDP data Li, J.Z. et al. (2008) Worldwide human relationships inferred from genome-wide patterns of variation. Science, 319: 1100-1104. (2) For the processing procedure Wang, C. et al. (2014) Ancestry estimation and control of population stratification for sequence-based association studies. Nature Genetics, 46: 409-415.

Final project title: Creating a 3D Visualization for 938 unrelated individuals from the Human Genome Diversity Project.

Getting access from the genomic SNP calls from an ethnically diverse panel. http://csg.sph.umich.edu/chaolong/LASER/ provides you the location (its on the Stanford site)
Load the data into R, and conduct PCA analysis.
Create a Web-app showing a 3-d graph where you color code the different regions.
I want to make sure that you are getting #1, and then started on the second part this week.

Create a 3D Visualization of for 938 unrelated individuals from the Human Genome Diversity Project.

Your data will be the 938 individuals here. http://csg.sph.umich.edu/chaolong/LASER/

PCA analysis graphing the top 3 principle components. The graph should be able to move and rotate. You should be able to select the axis, such that if I wanted to graph PC3 vs. PC4 vs PC5 (3D graph).

This download includes the results of the PCAâ€¦ However, I want to have you demonstrate that you can reproduce the results.

Notes.

The HGDP Illumina 650K SNP data set was originally reported by Li et al. (2008). We processed this data set so that it can be used as a reference panel for the LASER software in analyzing sequencing data. The data processing procedure was described in the supplementary materials of the LASER paper (Wang et al., 2014).

If you used this data set in your work, please cite the following papers:
